# Project 2: CS50-SlackClone

Flack

This is a single page chat web app that was done for Harvard's CS50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.  

The main objectives for this project were to learn to use Javascript to run code server-side, become more
comfortable with building web user interfaces, and to gain experience with Socket.IO to communicate between clients and servers.

This application allows users to sign in with a display name, create channels to communicate, as well as see and join
other channels in real time.  In addition, server side and local storage are used to allow for messages to be stored and 
display names and the channel last visited to be remembered.
